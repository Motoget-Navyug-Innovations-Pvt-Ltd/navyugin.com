        <h2>Why We Exist</h2>
        <p>
          Most of Bharatâ€™s EV mechanics and service hubs lack access to smart diagnosticsâ€”slowing adoption, increasing downtime, and leaving rural communities underserved. We exist to change that. Our deep-tech solutions are built for ruggedness, affordability, and true scalability, ensuring no part of India is left behind in the EV revolution.
